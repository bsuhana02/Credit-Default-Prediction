# Credit-Default-Prediction

**Problem Statement** : 
Financial threats are increasingly posing challenges to the credit risk assessment of commercial banks, particularly due to significant advancements in the financial industry. One of the most pressing threats faced by these banks is accurately predicting the credit risk of clients. This project aims to predict the probability of credit default based on the characteristics of credit card owners and their payment history.

**Approach**
To tackle the problem of credit default prediction, we will employ a systematic machine learning workflow comprising several key tasks:

**1. Data Exploration** : 
Investigate the dataset to understand its structure, identify data types, and uncover initial insights.
Visualize distributions, relationships, and trends within the data using graphs and statistical measures.

**2. Data Cleaning** :
Handle missing values through imputation or removal based on their significance and impact.
Detect and correct inconsistencies or anomalies within the dataset to ensure data integrity.

**3. Feature Engineering** :
Create new features that could enhance model performance, such as aggregating payment histories or encoding categorical variables.
Select relevant features that contribute significantly to predicting credit defaults while eliminating redundant or irrelevant ones.

**4. Model Building** :
Experiment with various classical machine learning algorithms to determine which models best fit the data. Potential algorithms to consider include:
Logistic Regression: A statistical model suitable for binary classification.
Decision Trees: A non-linear model that makes decisions based on feature values.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that utilizes multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): A powerful ensemble technique that builds models in a stage-wise manner to optimize prediction accuracy.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that identifies the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space.

**5. Model Testing** :
Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
Utilize cross-validation techniques to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data.

# Results
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a robust solution capable of predicting the probability of credit default based on the characteristics and payment histories of credit card owners. The performance of the models will be assessed through rigorous testing, and insights will be derived to help improve credit risk management strategies for commercial banks. By achieving this, the project aims to contribute to reducing financial risks and enhancing the stability of the banking sector.
